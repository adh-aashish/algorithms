# Waterjug-problem
In the water jug problem in Artificial Intelligence, we are provided with two jugs: one having the capacity to hold 3 gallons of water and the other has the capacity to hold 4 gallons of water. There is no other measuring equipment available and the jugs also do not have any kind of marking on them. So, the agentâ€™s task here is to fill the 4-gallon jug with 2 gallons of water by using only these two jugs and no other material. Initially, both our jugs are empty.<br>
Only one action can take place at a time
- empty one jug
- completely fill one jug
- transfer from one jug to another
